# Welcome to Ariel Ekgrens library,
###### the data store that anyone can submit PRs to: [https://github.com/ekgren/babel](https://github.com/ekgren/babel).

## The concept
The idea here is to create a library of LLM readable fully contained high quality interlinked data.  

If something is linked it should also be fully present on the data store.  

The storage structure for the data is to be decided. As well as the document format. The initial idea is to have the documents in markdown with metadata at the top of the document. The library will initially be in English and Swedish.  

Finally the concept of personal and general is not fully set either. But in principle there will be a highly personal part of the library for my own musings and a more general part that strives to be more impartial.
