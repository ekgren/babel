# Key file-naming concepts  

Create filenames that are **short, without spaces** between the words.
- Choose significant keywords that will be of use in future searches.  

Limit the number of characters to be typed (**fewer than 30 characters**) when creating filenames.  

Limit the number of characters in the path to **fewer than 256 characters**.  
- The path (URL) comprises all the successive levels making it possible to arrive at the location where the file is stored - successive folder names + filename.

Use **dashes "-"** instead of spaces.  
- The underscore "_" is used at the end to indicate the language, if necessary (e.g. _eng).

Use **Arabic numerals** instead of Roman numerals.  

**Date**: the formats YYYY_MM_DD and YYYYMMDD are both ISO compatible.  
- Choose the same data format for all documents handled.  

**Position of the date:** For each set of documents, decide whether it is best, for practical reasons, to place the date at the beginning of the filename or at the end, just before the document status (if the document status is used).  

**Do not use articles or linking words** (for example: the, of, for, on, so, etc. in English or le, la, du, de, en, pour, donc, sur, etc. in French).  

**Do not use accents** (acutes, grave accents, diaereses, circumflexes) or **cedillas** or any of the following **diacritics** (special characters) (non-exhaustive list):  
¨ ^ ° * ‘ « » " ° \` # { } [ ] < > | \ / @ = ~ + * % $ € ? : & # ; ,  

Create filenames in the language in which the document is drafted.  
- Give files meaningful names which will enable a maximum number of users to find them easily using the search tools. If the filenames are in the language used to draft the document, the language code will enable users to see that the document is available in other languages. **The absence of a language code means that the document has not been translated.**

If it is necessary to add an indication of the language in which the document is drafted, use the 3-letter language code of the ISO 639-2 alpha-3 biblio standard. This can be found in the language vocabulary, in the "code" field, once the language has been selected.
